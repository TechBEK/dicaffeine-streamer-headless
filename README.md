Dicaffeine Headless Streaming Installer

This is not for beginners.  You should have some sort of knowledge on linux before you get started.

This is pretty much a headless installer for dicaffeine.   You need the web frontend to purchase your license.

Once you register, you technically don't need the webfrontend anymore, as the file can just be base64 decoded.

I reference license in the the /home/pi/yuri directory.  You can modify the capture-usb.xml.template file to place accordingly, though I recommend you keep it all together.

Buy this software if you need cheap ndi streaming, it works great!
